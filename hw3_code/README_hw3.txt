How to run my code: 

	Download the ZIP file, hw3_code.zip, via CANVAS, this file includes codes the results for problem 2.
	The wrapper code imports MyBagging.py, MyRandomForest.py, MyAdaboost.py, and my_cross_val.py.

	Note: then use Python 3.6 + version to run hw3q2.py to get the results. 

Discussed and collaborated with Han Lu and Shuang Liu on problem 2. 

Thank you!
