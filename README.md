# Machine-Learning-and-Statistical-Learning-Codes
This repository contains some coding exercises about the fundamentals of machine learning and statistical learning methods that are learned from CSCI 5521 &amp; STAT 5052 by Xiang Liu. All codes are from scratch. 

See the Programming Assignment part for the descriptions of the coding tasks in each hw.pdf. In the file with codes, you can find README files for detailed steps on how to run my codes and get the results. 

HW1: 
        
    Consider three methods from the machine learning library scikit-learn: LinearSVC2, SVC3, and LogisticRegression4. Write code to perform k-fold cross-validation. 

HW2: 

    Q2: Compare the performance of three models:(i) MultiGaussClassify with full class covariance matrices, (ii) MultiGaussClassify with diagonal covariance matrices, and (iii) LogisticRegression3. Write codes to do a 5-fold cross-validation.
    
    Q3: Write code to implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and apply it to the Digits dataset by projecting the data to R2 using the first two principal components.
    
    Q4: k-means for image segmentation.

HW3: 

    Use the Digits dataset to classify handwriting ‘3’ vs ‘8’. The task is to build three classifiers: (a) bagging, (b) random forests, and (c) adaboost.

HW4: 

    Q2: The task is to implement the Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms, from scratch, using gradient descent to train your algorithms. 
    
    Q3: Use PyTorch1 to implement the Multilayer Perceptron Algorithm (MPA). We consider multiclass classification using the MNIST dataset where each sample is an image of a hand-written digit and has a corresponding label indicating the value of the digit written (0, 1, . . . , 9).
